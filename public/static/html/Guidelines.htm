                    <h2>Manuscript Preparation</h2>
                    <h3>General Considerations</h3>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc;padding-left: 20px ;">
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">
                            Research manuscripts should comprise:
                            <ul style="list-style: circle;padding-left: 20px ;">
                                <li style="list-style: circle;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">Front matter: Title, Author list, Affiliations, Abstract, Keywords </li>
                                <li style="list-style: circle;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">oResearch manuscript sections: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions.</li>
                                <li style="list-style: circle;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">oBack matter: Supplementary Materials, Acknowledgments, Author Contributions, Conflicts of Interest, References. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">Review manuscripts should comprise the front matter, literature review sections and the back matter. The template file can also be used to prepare the front and back matter of your review manuscript. It is not necessary to follow
                            the remaining structure. Structured reviews and meta-analyses should use the same structure as research articles and ensure they conform to the PRISMA guidelines.</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">Case reports should include a succinct introduction about the general medical condition or relevant symptoms that will be discussed in the case report; the case presentation including all of the relevant de-identified demographic
                            and descriptive information about the patient(s), and a description of the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome; a discussion providing context and any necessary explanation of specific treatment decisions; a conclusion
                            briefly outlining the take-home message and the lessons learned.</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">
                            <strong> Graphical Abstract:</strong>
                            <p>A graphical abstract (GA) is an image that appears alongside the text abstract in the Table of Contents. In addition to summarizing content, it should represent the topic of the article in an attention-grabbing way. </p>
                            <p>he GA should be a high-quality illustration or diagram in any of the following formats: PNG, JPEG, EPS, SVG, PSD or AI. Written text in a GA should be clear and easy to read, using one of the following fonts: Times, Arial,
                                Courier, Helvetica, Ubuntu or Calibri.</p>
                            <p>The minimum required size for the GA is 560 × 1100 pixels (height × width). When submitting larger images, please make sure to keep to the same ratio.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">Abbreviations should be defined in parentheses the first time they appear in the abstract, main text, and in figure or table captions and used consistently thereafter.</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">SI Units (International System of Units) should be used. Imperial, US customary and other units should be converted to SI units whenever possible.</li>

                            city, zip code, state/province, and country. At least one author should be designated as corresponding author, and his or her email address and other details should be included at the end of the affiliation section. Please
                            read the criteria to qualify for authorship. </li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">Abstract: The abstract should be a total of about 200 words maximum. The abstract should be a single paragraph and should follow the style of structured abstracts, but without headings: 1) Background: Place the question addressed
                            in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; 2) Methods: Describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied. Include any relevant preregistration numbers, and species and strains of any animals used. 3) Results:
                            Summarize the article's main findings; and 4) Conclusion: Indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an objective representation of the article: it must not contain results which are not presented
                            and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions.</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">Keywords: Three to ten pertinent keywords need to be added after the abstract. We recommend that the keywords are specific to the article, yet reasonably common within the subject discipline.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Research Manuscript Sections</h3>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc;padding-left: 20px ;">

                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">File for Figures and Schemes must be provided during submission in a single zip archive and at a sufficiently high resolution (minimum 1000 pixels width/height, or a resolution of 300 dpi or higher). Common formats are accepted,
                            however, TIFF, JPEG, EPS and PDF are preferred.</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">Any journal of Plow Publishing can publish multimedia files in articles or as supplementary materials. Please contact the editorial office for further information.</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">All Figures, Schemes and Tables should be inserted into the main text close to their first citation and must be numbered following their number of appearance (Figure 1, Scheme I, Figure 2, Scheme II, Table 1, etc.). All Figures,
                            Schemes and Tables should have a short explanatory title and caption.</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">All table columns should have an explanatory heading. To facilitate the copy-editing of larger tables, smaller fonts may be used, but no less than 8 pt. in size. Authors should use the Table option of Microsoft Word to create tables.</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc;overflow: visible;padding: 0;">Authors are encouraged to prepare figures and schemes in color (RGB at 8-bit per channel). There is no additional cost for publishing full color graphics.</li>

            </h4>
            <div class="panel" style="display: block;">
              <b>A:</b>目前SCI收录的核心刊3000多种，加上增补刊约5600种，因此，选择一本恰当的期刊是论文得以发表的一个重要环节。<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;选择期刊应考虑如下因素：<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.论文主题是否在杂志征稿范围内<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.论文格式是否符合杂志要求<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.论文是否符合杂志的一贯口味<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;您可以根据论文的主题，先列出一个简单拟选期刊表，然后逐一对比进行筛选，最后确定投稿期刊。您也可以通过与译偲的交流选择合适的期刊来发表您的论文。

            <h4><b>Q:</b>文章刚投上去就被拒掉了，是什么原因？</h4>
            <div class="panel">
              <b>A:</b>在进行同行评议（peer-review）之前被拒掉有多种原因。<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.文章的研究范围超出了杂志涵盖的范围；<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.论文观点和数据的创新性不够；<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.文章格式不符合杂志要求；<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.英文表达不畅或语法错误过多影响阅读。<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;译偲建议，在投稿之前，一定要仔细浏览杂志的<br>"Instructions for authors"，里面通常会有杂志对所投稿件的排版要求。<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;如果您选择译偲，我们的专业英文修改和排版团队将为您的英文和排版把关，杜绝文章送审之前被拒掉的情况发生。
            </div>
            <h4><b>Q:</b>应该在哪个阶段选择英文修改？</h4>
            <div class="panel">
              <b>A:</b>如果您所投的是传统纸质期刊，译偲建议您选择在文章投稿之前进行英文修改，因为传统期刊的编辑通常为其所在领域的专家，对文章格式的要求较高，流畅的英文表达和出色的排版可以给编辑留下美好的第一印象，以免在文章送审之前就被拒掉。<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;如果您所投的是Open
              Access的杂志，由于这类杂志快速发表的特点，编辑对文章格式上的要求相对较低，所以译偲建议您在文章投稿之前让我们进行英文把关以缩短文章发表周
              期，当然也可以选择在编辑返给您修改的时候进行英文修改。<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;不论您选择哪个阶段进行英文修改，译偲都不止为您修改文章，还可免费为您按照期刊要求进行排版，免费准备cover letter；免费修改 response

            <h4><b>Q:</b>作者推荐的审稿人会被邀请吗？</h4>
            <div class="panel">
              <b>A:</b>很多期刊都会要求作者推荐5个左右的审稿候选人，然而期刊编辑会不会邀请这些候选人则各不相同。有的期刊会选择邀请作者推荐的审稿人，有些期刊为了保证审稿报告的客观公正，会完全不邀请作者推荐的候选审稿人，即使邀请了推荐审稿人，也会邀请另一个专家进行审稿。
            </div>
            <h4><b>Q:</b>如果有审稿人给了负面意见，文章就会被拒掉吗？</h4>
            <div class="panel">
              <b>A:</b>不一定。文章最终的结果是综合所有审稿人和外部专家的意见之后而得出的。所以一定不要因为有了负面的报告就放弃修改。国际核
              心刊物的审稿人大多是各领域的权威学者，建议您重视审稿意见，对每一条批评和建议都要认真分析，并据此修改论文。当然，如果文章被同一领域的某个很有名的
              专家否定，那么被拒稿的可能性会大大增加。
            </div>
            <h4><b>Q:</b>如何对待杂志拒稿？</h4>
            <div class="panel">
              <b>A:</b>对于此类情况，译偲建议您仔细分析被拒稿的原因。<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;一些是"完全的拒绝"，编辑通常会表示对这类文章不愿再看到，那么再提交这类文章是没有意义的，可以换投其他杂志。<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;另一些是由于稿件修改难度较大，编辑通常会先做拒稿处理，然后要求作者根据审稿意见修改，再作为一篇新稿件投上来。<br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;当然，如果要求发表的时间很紧张，或者无法按照审稿人的要求完成相应的实验以增加数据支持，您可以将文
              章投到其他的期刊，同时应按照新投期刊的要求对文章重新排版并重新准备投稿信。
            </div>
            <h4><b>Q:</b>一篇文章同时投到多个期刊会增加接收的机率吗？</h4>
            <div class="panel">
              <b>A:</b>答案是否定的。所有编辑或者审稿人对一稿多投的行为都会非常反感，论文理所当然地会被拒掉，同时也会对作者在学术上的声誉造成恶劣的影响。
